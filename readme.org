* MotionEYE Chpos

Script to change position of cameras on a MotionEYE NVR.

NOTE: This is experimental, use at own risk, always backup before hand
(including the /etc/motioneye directory).

** Installation

On Linux

Clone
#+BEGIN_SRC sh

#+END_SRC

** Usage

1. Backup
   : chpos backup
   This will backup /etc/motioneye to /etc/motioneye-[date]

2. Change camera 4 to be camera 1
   : chpos camera4 camera1
   This will swap the camera4 & camera1 around. You should step
   through each camera position starting at position 1 and build your
   order.
